##Task

Create a 3D scene that uses the generated terrain as a base. Instead of having mountains, hills and trees be ground tiles, place them on cards in the 3D scene. Create a simple character that can walk around in this 3D world. Add collision so that the character cannot go through mountains or into water. The camera will follow the player.
